  Welcome - We begin the journey of learning how to program computers by
studying how web pages on the Internet work. Web pages are programmed in a
language called HTML, which is a special way to code how the web page looks. 

  HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it's just text along with 
commands called "tags" which tell your web browser how to show the text.

  For example, the code:

Did you <bold>hear</bold> that?

would make your browser show that sentence but the word "hear" would look 
bold, which means darker and stronger. Notice that "tags" are surrounded
by angle brackets. Tags must also get "closed" - the <bold> only works on
the word "hear" - the </bold> turns "off" the boldness, the slash on a tag
signifies the end or closing of a tag. No text passed this will show up as bold. 
Tags normally come in pairs like <p> and </p>, the first is called the "start
tag" and the second is called the "end tag"
